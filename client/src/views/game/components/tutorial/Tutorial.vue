      <h5>The Basics</h5>

      <p>
        The game runs in <strong>ticks</strong>, in standard games these occur
        once every <span class="text-warning">30 minutes</span>. Every time a
        tick occurs, carriers will move, ships are built, research is conducted,
        combat between players is performed and stars are captured.
      </p>

      <p>
        <span class="text-danger">Cosmic Odyssey is a slow game</span>, carriers
        travel in real-time and
        <span class="text-danger">will take real hours to complete.</span>
        It is perfectly normal to play a couple of minutes and come back hours
        later. In the meantime, many players will plan their next steps and
        engage in diplomacy.
      </p>

      <p class="text-warning">
        <i
          >Note: This tutorial is <strong>turn based</strong>, use the green
          tick at the top right to submit your turn and the game will progress
          within a few seconds.</i

    </div>

    <div v-if="page === 2">
      <h5>Galaxy</h5>

      <p>
        The map currently displays <strong>Stars</strong> and
        <strong>Carriers</strong> controlled by you and your opponent.
        <span class="text-danger"
          >Try zooming in and panning around to get a closer look</span
        >.
      </p>

      <h5>Stars</h5>

      <p>
        Stars on the map are displayed with their name, how many ships are
        garrisoned and how much infrastructure the star has. Stars controlled by
        players are coloured with the player's colour and stars that do not have
        an owner do not have a colour displayed.
      </p>

      <p>
        To win a game of Cosmic Odyssey, you must capture a specified number of
        stars. You are currently in control of
        <span class="text-info">{{ getStarCount.length }} stars</span> and you
        need to capture
        <span class="text-warning">{{ getStarsForVictory }} stars</span> to win
        the game and end the tutorial.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div v-if="page === 3">
      <h5>Infrastructure</h5>

      <p>
        There are 3 types of infrastructure that can be built at stars, these
        are:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong class="text-success">Economy</strong> - Generates income
        </li>
        <li><strong class="text-warning">Industry</strong> - Builds ships</li>
        <li>
          <strong class="text-info">Science</strong> - Contributes to research
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        At the start of the game, you are in control of
        <span class="text-info">{{ getStartingStars }} stars</span>. Click on a
        star on the map to view the star detail screen.
      </p>

      <p>
        <span class="text-danger"
          >Try upgrading the <strong>Industry</strong> infrastructure on one of
          your stars</span
        >, this will increase the build speed of ships at the star.
      </p>

      <p>
        The numbers displayed directly above stars on the map are the
        <span class="text-success">Economy</span>,
        <span class="text-warning">Industry</span> and
        <span class="text-info">Science</span> (<span class="text-success me-1"
          >E</span
        ><span class="text-warning me-1">I</span
        ><span class="text-info">S</span>) values of the star.
      </p>

      <p class="text-warning">
        <i
          >Submit your turn and in a few seconds you will see ships being built
          at stars.</i
        >
      </p>
    </div>

    <div v-if="page === 4">
      <h5>Carriers &amp; Waypoints</h5>

      <p>
        In order to capture stars, you must build <strong>Carriers</strong>, use
        carriers to transport ships across the galaxy to stars in order to
        capture them. A carrier must have at least 1 ship.
      </p>

      <p>
        Carriers can only be built at stars with garrisoned ships,
        <span class="text-danger"
          >click on any of your stars and build a carrier there</span
        >.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div v-if="page === 5">
      <h5>Capturing Stars</h5>

      <p>
        Once you've built the carrier, edit the waypoints of the carrier to
        travel to stars that you do not own to capture them, make sure you
        <span class="text-danger">load the carrier with enough ships</span> in
        case they run into a combat situation.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the start of the game, your capital star
        <a href="javascript:;" @click="onOpenStarDetailRequested">{{
          getPlayerHomeStar.name
        }}</a>
        has a carrier for free. Use this carrier to plot waypoints to stars.
      </p>

      <p class="text-warning">
        <i
          >Submit your turn and in a few seconds you will your carriers follow
          their waypoints and travel to nearby stars.</i
        >
      </p>
    </div>

    <div v-if="page === 6">
      <h5>Research &amp; Technology</h5>

      <p>
        Researching technology upgrades is critical in order to stay ahead of
        your opponents. Technology is researched every tick using the
        <span class="text-info">Science</span> infrastructure built at your
        stars. The more science your stars have, the faster you will research
        new technologies.
      </p>

      <p>
        <span class="text-danger"
          >Use the menu at the <strong>top right</strong> of the screen to
          navigate to the <strong>Research</strong> screen</span
        >
        and set your current research to <span class="text-info">Weapons</span>.
        This will make your ships more powerful and hit harder in combat once
        researched.
      </p>

      <p class="text-warning">
        <i
          >Submit your turn and in a few seconds you will see your research
          points increase.</i
        >
      </p>
    </div>

    <div v-if="page === 7">
      <h5>How to Win</h5>

      <p>
        To win a game of Cosmic Odyssey, you must capture a specified number of
        stars. You are currently in control of
        <span class="text-info">{{ getStarCount.length }} stars</span> and you
        need to capture
        <span class="text-warning">{{ getStarsForVictory }} stars</span> to win
        the game and end the tutorial.
      </p>

      <p class="text-danger">
        Keep producing ships, building carriers and plotting waypoints.
        Eliminate your opponent and capture the <strong>entire map</strong> to
        win this tutorial.
